It's been some time since I've wrote an article, I tried to get myself to write one a few times but never could. It felt like I had to derive what I had and made it look like it's purpose was to get jobs or money, something of value instead of having personal value. I didn't want to move away from that, the simplicity of my blog is exactly what I like. It's Ruby Jekyll with Markdown posts that get stored on GitHub. There is no search bar, just pagination and simple colors. To move away and to "update" it would make it feel like it would be the death of my intention of this site from the start. It is a place for me to learn and reflect back on what I thought was worthy and purpose later write about things that I thought were not worthy but was.
